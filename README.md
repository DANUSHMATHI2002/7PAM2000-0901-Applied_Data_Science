Statistics and Trends Assignment-1
# 1. INTRODUCTION
The influence of technology on our daily lives, especially with regard to sleep quality, have drawn a lot of
attention in the current digital era. This study investigates the relationship between daytime tiredness and a
number of factors including breakfast routines, sleep duration, and phone dependence. The goal of
evaluating a sleep research dataset is to find trends that can advise better sleep practices and improved health
in general.
# 2. BAR CHART: Daytime Tiredness by Phone Dependency and Breakfast Habit
1. Bar Chart Analysis: The graph displays the average level of daytime tiredness broken down by
breakfast habits and phone dependence.
2. Key Findings: Those who skip breakfast and have a high phone dependency are more likely to feel
exhausted during the day. This implies that breakfast is crucial for reducing tiredness, particularly for
people who use their phones a lot.
3. Implication: Encouraging breakfast intake could decrease tiredness and increase alertness.
# 3. Scatter Plot: Sleep Hours vs Daytime Tiredness
1. Scatter Plot Insights: This plot shows the relationship between sleep hours and daytime tiredness.
2. Expected Trend: A negative correlation is expected, indicating that more sleep generally leads to
less daytime tiredness. The average tiredness line shows how many people are above or below
average.
# 4. BOX PLOT: Sleep Deficit by Enough Sleep Status
1. Box Plot Analysis: The box plot shows the distribution of sleep deficits depending on self-reported
sleep quality. Outliers may suggest people with severe inadequate sleep.
2. Key Observation: Significant differences in median sleep deficit exist between individuals who
believe they get enough sleep and those who do not.
3. Descriptive Statistics: Summarized statistics provide insights into the variation of sleep deficit
across various groups.
# 5. CONCLUSION
Individuals reported an average sleep duration of 6.66 hours and an average daily tiredness level of 3.08,
indicating that individuals who did not get enough sleep (less than 8 hours) may feel more restless. There are
43 people with high phone dependency and 61 with low phone dependency, indicating that reduced phone
dependency may be associated with improved sleep quality. The individuals&#39; cumulative sleep deficit of
147.00 hours, or 1.41 hours per person on average, highlights serious problems with sleep quality.
Furthermore, 36participants believe they get enough sleep, whereas 68 do not, indicating a widespread
perception of insufficient rest among the group.
